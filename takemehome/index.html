			<h1>Take Me Home</h1>
			<p>Take Me Home is a bike rack that questions 
			forms in interior design. Unlike all else in your room, it can serve only one practical function and when it cannot, it becomes a sculpture. Take Me Home focuses on form and function, purpose and aesthetics.</p>
			<p>Take Me Home has been designed in London and made in Gdansk, Poland. It is a response to a self-directed brief at Camberwell College of Arts, and is a result of cooperation with my dad and brother, both experienced in furniture making.</p>
			<p>Take Me Home comes with a set of instructions and equipment on how to attach to the wall. The process is simple and aims to bring you closer to your furniture.</p> 
			<p>The photographs purposefully do not show the product in its intended setting. Each space Take Me Home ends up in is unique, and we encourage creativity in its placement.</p>
